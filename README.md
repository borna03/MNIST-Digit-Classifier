# MNIST Digit Recognition

This project implements a digit recognition application using the MNIST dataset. It consists of a Python script for training an ML keras model on the MNIST dataset (~98% test accuracy), with a graphical user interface designed using Pygame. This interface allows for real-time drawing and recognition of digits.

## Usage
- To start the application for image classification, run: `python main.py`
- To train the model and save it using Keras, run: `python Train.py`

## Interface Instructions
- Draw your digit on the canvas.
- Press the 'Classify' button to recognize the digit.
- To clear the canvas and start over, press 'c'.
